<center>Reading the Grain on a Golf Course Green:  A Machine-Learning Challenge</center>

I have spent more than twenty years cutting cups on golf course greens.  Like a lot of other people, I have observed that one side of a golf cup is usually more ‘distressed’ than the other.  An example is shown here.

The conventional wisdom is that this phenomenon is not due to poor technique on the part of the cup cutter but due to the grain of the grass in the locality of the hole.  In fact, serious golfers will often look for the distressed edge of a cup and adjust their putting stroke accordingly.

But whenever I ‘eye-ball’ the turf around a cup I can’t pick up any features that correlate with the direction defined by the distressed edge.  Either there are none to be seen and conventional wisdom is perhaps wrong or they are too subtle to be picked out by casual observation.

The objective of this project is to provide a large data set for computer scientists and mathematicians to discover the putative subtleties.  If features are indeed found, the long-term hope is that they can be used to determine grain without having to cut a cup.
